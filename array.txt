Array Defination
    Array are fundamental structures in java that allow us to store multiple values of the same type
    in a single variable.
    1.In java, all arrays are dynamically allocated.
    2.Arrays are stored in contiguous memory .
    3.Since arrays are objects in java, we can find thir length using the objects property length
      This is different from C/C++
    4.A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
    5.It is a simplest data structure where each data element can be accessed directly by only using
      its index number.
    6.The variables in the array are ordered, and each has an index beginning with 0.
Array Declaration.
    Syntax:
        Method 1: datatype var-name[];
        method 2: datatype [] var-name;
    type: The data type of the array elements (e.g-int,string).
    arrayname : The name of the array.
Creating Array
    int a[] = { 12,3,4,56,7};
Accessing Array Elements.
    int a[] = {12,3,4,56,7};
    System.out.println(a[3],a[2]);
Finding length of the array
    int a[] = {12,3,4,56,7};
    int len a.length;
    System.out.println(len);

Types of Arrays in Java.
1.Single Dimensional Array
     A single Dimensional: These are common types of arrays,where elements are stored in a linear order.
     int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
2.Two Dimensional Array
    Arrays with more than one Dimension, such as two-Dimension arrays(matrices)
    A 2D array (matrix)
    int[] multiDimension = {
        {1,2,3},
        {4,5,6},
        {7,8,9}
    };
3.Multi Dimensional Array
    int [][][]intarray = new int[10][24][45]
4.Loops 
1.for-each Loops
Syntax = for (type variable : arrayname)
